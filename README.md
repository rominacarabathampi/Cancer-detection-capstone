# Capstone-brainstation
Capstone Project as part of Brainstation's bootcamp completion.

# Abstract
From genetic therapy to detection of various diseases, AI has revolutionized medical research. Recently, health researchers have innovatively applied AI to one of the most pressing health concerns of the century: cancer. Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women. This project trains an AI model to detect cancer tissue in microscopic images. Early detection of metastatic tissue could potentially support health providers in developing swift diagnosis for patients, possibly saving their lives.
